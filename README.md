# Clicky-Writer
Clicky is a simple random file selector/mover tool, to get started open "clickywriter#setup". Copy paste your directory in the cmd and you're set!
"Clicky.py" is the application you want to open to randomly open a file in the directory you entered in the setup.
"Clickywriter#.py" is the application you want to open to move files.
Since Clicky records the files you open and stores them so you don't randomly open them again, there's a cache. To reset the cache, open "CacheReset.py"
"Clicky.py" is not affected by the cache, but "Clickyother.py" is.
